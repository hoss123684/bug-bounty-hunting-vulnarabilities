Let's analyze the requests and responses:

I see that the username is reflected back as a cookie in response

Redirected to login2(Get) with the cookie, it ask you to enter your mfa-code that you recieved in your email

Now let's intercept the POST request of sending your mfa-code:

I see that the request include the cookie in the POST request, the next step i will change the cookie in every requst i sent.
somthing interesting happens here ,after sending the GET request to /login2 with cookie = carlos beyond to cookie = wiener :
